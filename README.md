# TRIBE SALES PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS

## Description
This project analyses Tribe’s sales transaction data to understand how revenue and sales volume vary across regions, markets, stores, and product categories. The goal is to generate practical insights that support revenue growth, market prioritisation, and sales strategy decisions.

## Objective
The objective of this project is to evaluate sales performance across regions, markets, and lines of business, and to identify the key drivers of revenue and units sold to support data-driven decision-making.

## Business Questions
The analysis was guided by the following questions:
1. How many units are sold across each region?
2. How does revenue relate to units sold?
3. How does revenue vary across different lines of business?
4. Which regions generate the highest total revenue?
5. How many units are sold within each line of business?
6. Which markets contribute the most to overall revenue?
7. How is revenue distributed across stores within each region?
